# reddit_spam_detector_bot
Bot that detects spam/affiliate marketing authors, and posts some stats on their threads.

To use:

Fill in your API credentials to praw_creds.py

Run with to_catch_a_spammer.py

I am already running this on Udemy-specific spam, so you shouldn't do the same thing as I am doing. There's no need to have multiple reddit bots posting on the same threads.
